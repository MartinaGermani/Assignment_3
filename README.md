# Assignment_3
## Introduction
For this assignment, I have developed a software architecture for the control of the robot in the environment. 
I have controlled 3 different behaviours of the robot, depending on user’s input, in particular, if the user enters the letter:
•	“a”, the robot has to autonomously reach a (x, y) coordinate inserted by the user,
•	“m”, the user can manually drive the robot using the keyboard,
•	“c”, the user can manually drive the robot using the keyboard but there are some controls in order to avoid collision.
